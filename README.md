# âŠ— Tic Tac Toe
---
Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

tkinter Python library is used to create the GUI. Two options are available to play the game, along with the system or with another player.

A small winning strategy is used to play with the system. The system will try to find the best place to put its naught or cross by which the system will win or try to stop players to win.
